## 📖 Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ⛵ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned overtop bare-metal Ubuntu Server. This is a semi hyper-converged cluster using one node which is a VPS provided by [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com)'s Cloud offering, workloads and block storage using the [HCloud CSI Driver](https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver/) to access Volumes that can be mounted directly to the VPS or via a [Hetzner Storage Box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box).

### Core Components

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) and [snapscheduler](https://github.com/backube/snapscheduler): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
├─📁 bootstrap     # Flux installation
├─📁 flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
└─📁 apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
```

## 🤝 Gratitude and Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
